Optical multilayer thin film structures have been widely used in numerous photonic domains and
applications. The key component to enable these applications is the inverse design. Different from other
photonic structures such as metasurface or waveguide, multilayer thin film is a one-dimensional structure,
which deserves its own treatment for the design process. Optimization has always been the standard design
algorithm for decades. Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of integrating different deep
learning algorithms to tackle the inverse design problems. A natural question to ask is: how do these
algorithms differ from each other? Why do we need to develop so many algorithms and what type of
challenges do they solve? What is the state-of-the-art algorithm in this domain? Here, we review recent
progress and provide a guide-tour through this research area, starting from traditional optimization to recent
deep learning approaches. Challenges and future perspective are also discussed.
