Optical multilayer thin film structures are widely used in many photonic applications. The important part to enable these applications is inverse design, which seeks to identify a suitable structure that satisfy desired optical responses. We propose a self-improving data augmentation technique by leveraging neural networks' extrapolation ability. Using this method, we show significant improvement in various real-applicative design tasks with minimum fine-tuning, which can also be potentially generalized to inverse scientific foundation models.
